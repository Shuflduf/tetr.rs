If this looks a LOT like [tetr.gp](https://macroquad.rs/),
it's because I wanted to see how similar I could make the same game
in two completly different languages.

The reason I decided to remake tetr.rs is because the original
(now called [tetr.rs.bevy](https://github.com/Shuflduf/tetr.rs.bevy)) was made in Bevy,
which might as well be a completly different language than Rust.
