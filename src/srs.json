    "The Super Rotation System from most modern Tetris games",
    "Sources: https://tetris.wiki/SRS, https://tetris.wiki/Scoring",
    "The pieces are defined from the top left square, where +x is right and +y is down",
    "It goes in order of the rainbow, with Red being the first and going to Pink being last",
    "Red = Z, Orange = L, Yellow = O, Green = S, Cyan = I, Blue = J, Pink = T",
    "You can access the position of a block in a piece in a rotation by using pieces[Piece][Rotation][Block][0 for x, 1 for y]",
    "Each rotation state is perfect, meaning the tip of a piece shares the index with the tip of the next rotation",
    "The kicks are the offsets to test when a piece collides with a wall or another piece",
    "To get the list of kicks to test, follow this pattern:",
    "1. Get the index of the current rotation state of the piece",
    "2. Get the index of the next rotation state of the piece",
    "3. If you're going clockwise, the index you want will be odd, and if you're going counterclockwise, it will be even",
    "In other words, the mapping is as follows (R = clockwise once from spawn, L = counterclockwise once from spawn, 2 = 2 rotations from spawn, 0 = 0 rotations from spawn):",
    "0->R = 0, R->0 = 1, R->2 = 2, 2->R = 3, 2->L = 4, L->2 = 5, L->0 = 6, 0->L = 7",
    "I Pieces (Cyan) use a seperate set of kicks",
    "180 spins arent supported currently, maybe I'll add them later",
    "For scoring: scoring_lines can be used by getting the number of lines cleared, and using that - 1 as the index, so 1 line clear would be scoring_lines[0]",
    "scoring_tspin can be used by directly using the number of lines cleared as the index, so 1 line clear would be scoring_tspin[1]",
    "scoring_mini is the same as scoring_tspin, except for mini tspins"
